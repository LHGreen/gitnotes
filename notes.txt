#Overview of Git

Git consists of three parts

* the directory where your files are 
* the staging area where you construct the next version
* the object store where the versions are stored

# setting up Git

## Settings

```
git config --global user.name "name"
git config --global user.email "email"
git config --global colour.ui auto
git config --global core.editor "gedit"
```
Online, using "gedit -w -s" is recommended, since this is supposed to block user input until text into gedit is entered, then return to the editor or something, but it doesn't seem to work. Meh. 

The `--global` option sets the settings for the whole computer, instead of just the directory

## Initialization

The command `git init` creates the git staging and object store in the current directory.
