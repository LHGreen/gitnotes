#Overview of Git

Git consists of three parts

* the directory where your files are 
* the staging area where you construct the next version
* the object store where the versions are stored

# setting up Git

## Settings

```
git config --global user.name "name"
git config --global user.email "email"
git config --global color.ui auto
git config --global core.editor "gedit"
```
Online, using "gedit -w -s" is recommended, since this is supposed to block user input until text into gedit is entered, then return to the editor or something, but it doesn't seem to work. Meh. 

The `--global` option sets the settings for the whole computer, instead of just the directory

## Initialization

The command `git init` creates the git staging and object store in the current directory.

#Creating the next version

1. Make the desired changes to the files
2. Stage the changes to be at the next version 
3. Commit the staged changes as the next version

ex. 
```
gedit notes.txt
git add notes.txt
git commit
```
